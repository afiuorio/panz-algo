#  panz-algo

This repository is a collection of algorithms written in C I wrote during my undergraduate studies.

This library is a little personal project and it doesn't pretend to be a substitute for more stable or performance-oriented libraries. The purpose of this library is simply to implement some of the algorithms and data structure I needed in my undergraduate classes for better understand them.

## Algorithms implemented

- Quicksort
- Insertion sort
- Radix sort

- Binary search

- Cos and sin operations
- Sqrt
- Abs

- LCG random number generator
- String functions (copy, cat and compare)
- Matrix data structure

## Build

You can reuse the implementation of each algorithm separately as long as you respected the LICENCE file.

You can also build a dynamic library with every algorithm using the makefile in the repository. On Linux is should be as easy as a:

```bash
make
make check
```
